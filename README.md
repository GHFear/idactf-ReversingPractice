# idactf-ReversingPractice

This was some fun ctf by HexRays back in 2023. <br>

I reverse engineered about 90% of the application, which is functionally the same as the original program. <br>

Solutions to the ctf are in **Solutions.h** <br>
Reversed source code is in **idactf.cpp** <br>

To compile and run, you need to decompress openssl-1.1.1w.zip <br><br>

## Information

This was accomplished only by statically analyzing the binary using IDA Pro.<br>
